1: The program is compilable using javac Main.java.
2: The main method is in the Main.java file. Start the program by writing java Main "filename.txt".
3: In my first implementation, I assumed there would only be one node with 0 inedges, this has been rectified
in the second implementation.
4: For some reason I got an integeroutofbounds on my arraylist for staff at a given point in time. To work around it,
I populated the list with 1000 zeroes. This does add complexity when I print out the project schedule, since it has to
check a 1000-length arraylist.
5: All functions as specified by the assignment appear to be functional.
6: Most code is at least inspired by similar problems solved on stackoverflow.
